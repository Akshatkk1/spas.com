                        This system is helpful for student and their parents and also for teachers.
                        Student or their parents can check attendance, marks whenever they want, were ever they want.
                        It will require less time to access and deliver student performance records. 
                        It will help student to monitor regarding their academics and other areas where 
                        improvement is needed. 
                        It will help to assist in keeping track of student progress throughout the semester. 
                        This system will include a user login to provide user interface. 
                        The purpose of this student performance analysis website is to save time by providing 
                        performance reports to students and their parents through this website. 
                        It will be simple interface to teachers and it doesn't require any planning or setup. 
                        The different types of reports related to student performance can be generated for parents easily.
